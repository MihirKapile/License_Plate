In this program , 
I have used Numpy for the numerical operations 
Matplotlib to Plot the accuracy of the the model and to display the result
Opencv to read the images
Keras from Tensorflow to build and train a model
OS and Glob to access input files
Etree from lxml to reduce the size of the images to the appropirate size
